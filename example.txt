Here is the remote line that Eric just added!
    
Here is a sample file
with multiple lines to edit.

Change, delete, or add any lines, and
see what happens.

hello there
how goes it?

======= Don't Edit These Lines ===========

After you save the changes locally, you should run commands such as:
$ git status

to see which files have changed.

To see which specific lines have changed, you can use:
$ git diff

or

$ git gui.

To stage your changes to be committed, use:
$ git add sample.txt

Make changes to any other files, or create/delete them and add them as well. A shortcut for
adding all files is:
$ git add .

When you're ready to commit the changes, use:
$ git commit -m "Include your message here."

=========================================

with and change.
